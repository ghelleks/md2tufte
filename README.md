# md2tufte

Some scaffolding to create a reveal.js presentation and Tufte-compliant
handout from the same Markdown source.

## The Source

Your markdown file (see `[sample.md](https://github.com/ghelleks/md2tufte/blob/master/sample.md)`) starts with some metadata, like:

```
% My Title
% My Name
% 12 November 2014
```

(For more complicated metadata, play with `[sample.yaml](https://github.com/ghelleks/md2tufte/blob/master/sample.yaml)`)

Three simple rules for the rest:

1. Top-level headers become top-level slides.
2. Second-level headers become secondary slides (arrow up and down to navigate
them)
3. Everything inside the `<div class="notes">` tag becomes speaker notes.

Shazam.

## Usage

```
$ make
```

Boom. Check out the output directory. 

(Obviously, we could elaborate on this.)
