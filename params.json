Top-level headers become top-level slides.\r\n2. Second-level headers become secondary slides (arrow up and down to navigate\r\nthem)\r\n3. Everything inside the `<div class=\"notes\">` tag becomes speaker notes.\r\n\r\nShazam.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nYes, please. PRs very, very welcome.\r\n\r\n## Colophon\r\n\r\nBased on the examples from pandoc:\r\n\r\n  http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/demo/example9/producing-slide-shows-with-pandoc.html\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
